These .m files were written to calculate Delta14C and the projection ages to Marine20, along with 2 sigma error ellipses, of oceanic radiocarbon data with known calendar ages. You can also determine the projection ages to another calibration curve by simply replacing the marine20.m file.

The Projection_Age.m and Delta14C.m files were written by Tianyu Chen (tianyuchen@nju.edu.cn) and updated by Tao Li (taoli@nigpas.ac.cn). Please feel free to modify and distribute the script. For any questions, contact tianyuchen@nju.edu.cn. If you utilize the code for performing projection age calculations, kindly cite the original publication (Chen et al., 2023, "Radiocarbon evidence for the stability of polar ocean overturning during the Holocene").

You can simply go to Plot_projection_age.m (or Plot_Delta14C.m) to execute the script as a demonstration. The resulting plot will display the projection ages (or Delta14C) of Burdwood Bank deep-sea coral record at water depth of 1879 m.
